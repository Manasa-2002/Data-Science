      "Running is very good for humans in many different ways.  It is a great way to get exercise, and a great way to meet new people.  There are many positives, and some negatives, it is easy, enjoyable and makes humans more social, you can do it at anytime, and it relieves stress rather than give stress.  Although there are some negatives with running, there are also many positives.  Many people run because of the health reasons.  It is good for the heart and lungs and people run in the fresh air.  Running outside rather than inside is good for you too because of the fresh air.  Running also relieves tension, by running, people can think about their problems without having to worry about anyone hearing them.  They can think about whatever…show more content…\n",
      "There can also be too much competition which happens when there are people competing for a prize.  People can also get discouraged when running because some are doing it to lose weight and some do not lose weight.  People can also “hit the wall” when running which happens when a person overdoes their exercise and can be physically harmed.  Although there are some negatives, there are more positives to running. Running is easy, enjoyable and is very social.  Many people see running as a good place to meet new people and enjoyable to do, it is also one of the easiest ways to exercise.   Running can be very fun, it is easy because you need no experience to run.  Training for races is also fun it can be done by men and women, girls and boys at any age.  You can meet new people who can be very social able, you can meet new people by either running by yourself or with a friend or spouse.  People of all sizes and races and ages can run it is a great way to meet new people and a great way to exercise. Running is a great way to exercise and you could do it anytime and anywhere.  People can run either on streets or on paths, but paths are a bit more ideal.  Running is more ideal to do on hard surfaces, but is better exercise if you do it on uneven ground\n"
